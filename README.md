# Detecting Weaponary in Images

## Background
Here we dive into utilizing deep learning for image classification, in specific a convolutional neural network. The objective here is to classify whether or not an image contains 
weaponary. 

The Detecting Weapons.py file shows/covers all code used in the application of the objective.
The Detecting Weapons using Deep Learning report will in detail cover the thought proccess behind the objective. 

## Data
Images were used to feed into the network. The data directory consist of two folders the "weapons" folder holding 382 filtered images of basic weaponary ( guns & knives),
and the "safe" folder holding 300 filtered images of non-threating images.
